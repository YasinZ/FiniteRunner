# FiniteRunner

Initially I had the idea to create a game similar to Temple Run. After creating a basic track I wanted to switch from the run forever theme to something more finite. Based off of the difficulty, the player had to complete a certain number of tracks before fighting a boss. I tried to accomplish too much with this game. Because of that, the boss has several bugs including one where he just pushes you through the floor. By far the most valuable feature I learned from creating this game was working with AI. The final boss uses your position as well as the random blocks to follow you around.
Still, players found the game enjoyable and liked the different difficulties. All assets were aquired from the Unity asset store.
